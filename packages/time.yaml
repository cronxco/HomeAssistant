# This package deals with time and all time-based automations



# This sensor is what allows HASS to know what time it is (and date, day of week etc.)
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'

#    Automatic Time Modes
#
#    04:30 until sunrise*: Dawn
#    Sunrise until midday: Morning
#    Midday until sunset: Afternoon
#    Sunset* until 22:00: Evening
#    22:00 until 04:30: Night
#
#    *Note: Due to geographical location, sunrise never takes place prior to 04:30 and sunset never takes place after 22:00. These modes are therefore location appropriate. Your milage may vary...

  time_mode:
    name: Time Mode
    options:
      - Dawn
      - Morning
      - Afternoon
      - Evening
      - Night

# These are then the time-based automations

automation:

# 1: 04:30: Reset everything (but not guest_mode or holiday_mode), turn on dawn_mode and turn off night_mode.
# Aside: this is also when the presence module checks to see if anyone is home - if not then holiday_mode is automagically switched on.
