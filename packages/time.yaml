# This package deals with time and all time-based automations



# This sensor is what allows HASS to know what time it is (and date, day of week etc.)

      - 'time'
      - 'date'

#    Automatic Time Modes
#
#    04:30 until sunrise*: Dawn
#    Sunrise until midday: Morning
#    Midday until sunset: Afternoon
#    Sunset* until 22:00: Evening
#    22:00 until 04:30: Night
#
#    *Note: Due to geographical location, sunrise never takes place prior to 04:30 and sunset never takes place after 22:00. These modes are therefore location appropriate. Your milage may vary...
